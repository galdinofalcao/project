Description
This project is a Web App designed to explore various properties of a used car dataset. By leveraging an interactive interface, users can analyze and visualize distributions within the dataset. The tool provides insights into car models, prices, and other important metrics through interactive visualizations.

The application is built using Python and the following libraries:
1) Streamlit: creates an interactive web-based interface and enables easy exploration of data
2) Pandas: allows data manipulation and preprocessing to extract meaningful insights
3) Plotly Express: creates visually appealing and interactive charts and graphs

Features
1) Vehicle Types by Year: Users can select a specific car type (e.g., sedan, SUV, truck, etc.) to compare the number of vehicles available for each year.
2) Price vs Model Year vs Days Listed vs Odometer: By selecting up to three types of transmissions, users can visualize a comparison across car price, model year, days listed, and odometer readings.
3) Compare Price Distribution by Model: An interactive visualization where users can select two different car models to compare their price distributions through a histogram.
